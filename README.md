Analysis of eco-evolutionary dynamics using HMSC. Code accompanies the manuscript Detection of eco-evolutionary dynamics in communities using Joint Species Distribution Models, by Jelena H. Pantel and Ruben J. Hermann. In the code/R folder, files are numbered in order of their relevance for analyses in the main text. File 1_metacom_sim_v01.R is the metacommunity simulation model used in Section 'Evolution in metacommunities and HMSC' and file 1_metacom_sim_v02.R executes the simulations across dispersal and heritability levels. File 2_results_sim.R gives code for evaluating the results of the simulaton model (including alpha, beta, and gamma diversity levels). File 3_main_v01.R gives the code for fitting metacom simulation data to the HMSC model and file 3_main_v02.R gives the HMSC code for the simulation model fits presented in Figure 2. File 4_diagnostics.R gives the code to do HMSC model checking and assessing the quality of the model fit to data. File 5_results_hmsc.R gives code for evaluating the posterior parameter estimates and variation partitions for HMSC model results. File 6_emp_hmsc.R gives code for empirical analyses presented in Section 'Applying HMSC to empirical data'. Code is also given to recreate manuscript Figures 1 and 2.
