abstract = {The major theories regarding the combined influence of the environment and species interactions on population and community dynamics appear to conflict. Stress/disturbance gradient models of community organization, such as the stress gradient hypothesis, emphasize a diminished role for competition in harsh environments whereas modern coexistence theory does not. Confusion about the role of species interactions in harsh environments is perpetuated by a disconnect between population dynamics theory and data. We linked theory and data using response surface experiments done in the field to parameterize mathematical, population-dynamic competition models. We replicated our experiment across two environments that spanned a common and important environmental stress gradient for determining community structure in benthic marine systems. We generated quantitative estimates of the effects of environmental stress on population growth rates and the direction and strength of intra- and interspecific interactions within each environment. Our approach directly addressed a perpetual blind spot in this field by showing how the effects of competition can be intensified in stressful environments even though the apparent strength of competition remains unchanged. Furthermore, we showed how simultaneous, reciprocal competitive and facilitative effects can stabilize population dynamics in multispecies communities in stressful environments.},

abstract = {Abstract Species distribution modelling is an active area of research in ecology. In recent years, interest has grown in modelling multiple species simultaneously, partly due to the ability to ‘borrow strength’ from similar species to improve predictions. Mixed and hierarchical models allow this but typically assume a (generalised) linear relationship between covariates and species presence and absence. On the other hand, popular machine learning techniques such as random forests and boosted regression trees are able to model complex nonlinear relationships but consider only one species at a time. We apply multi-output Gaussian processes (MOGPs) to the problem of species distribution modelling. MOGPs model each species' response to the environment as a weighted sum of a small number of nonlinear functions, each modelled by a Gaussian process. While Gaussian process models are notoriously computationally intensive, recent techniques from the machine learning literature as well as using graphics processing units (GPUs) allow us to scale the model to datasets with hundreds of species at thousands of sites. We evaluate the MOGP against four baseline models on six different datasets. Overall, the MOGP is competitive with the best single-species and joint-species models, while being much faster to fit. On single-species metrics (AUC and log likelihood), the MOGP and single-output GPs outperformed tree-based models (random forest and boosted regression trees) and a joint species distribution model (JSDM). Compared to single-output GPs, the MOGP generally has a higher AUC for rare species with fewer than 50 observation in the dataset. When evaluated using joint-species log likelihood, the MOGP outperforms all models apart from the JSDM, which has a better joint likelihood on three datasets and similar performance on the three others. A key advantage of the MOGP is speed: on the largest dataset, it is around 18 times faster than fitting single output GPs, and over 80 times faster to fit than the JSDM. Our results suggest that both MOGPs and SOGPs are accurate predictive models of species distributions and that the MOGP is particularly compelling when predictions for rare species are of interest.},

abstract = {Species distribution models are useful for estimating the distribution and environmental preferences of rare species, but these same species are challenging to model on account of sparse data. We contrast a traditional single-species approach (generalized linear models, GLMs) with two promising frameworks for modeling rare species: ensembles of small models (ESMs), which average across simple models; and multi-species distribution models (MSDMs), which allow rarer species to benefit from statistical ‘borrowing of strength' from more common species. Using a virtual species within a community of real species, we evaluated how model accuracy was influenced by the number of occurrences of the rare species (N = 2–64), niche breadth, and similarity to more numerous species' niches. For discriminating between presence and absence, ESMs with just linear terms (ESM-L) performed best for N ≤ 4, whereas for GLMs and ESMs with polynomial terms (ESM-P) were best for N ≥ 8. For calibrating the species' response to influential variables, the MSDM hierarchical modeling of species communities (HMSC) and ESM-P were best for species with niches similar to those of other species. For species with dissimilar niches, ESM-P did best for N ≥ 8, but no model was well calibrated for smaller sample sizes. For identifying uninfluential variables, ESM-L and species archetype models (SAMs), a type of MSDM, did well for ≤ 4, and ESM-L for N ≥ 8. Models of species with narrow niches dissimilar to others had the highest discrimination capacity compared to models for generalist species and/or species with niches similar to other species' niches. ‘Borrowing of strength' in MSDMs can assist with some inference tasks, but does not necessarily improve predictions for rare species; simpler, single-species models may be better at a given task. The best algorithm depends on modeling goal (discrimination versus calibration), sample size, and niche breadth and similarity.

A large dynamic range is particularly prevalent when the populations are highly abundant, change considerably over time, and exhibit a large signal-to-noise ratio. By contrast, MAR models are better suited for analyses of populations with low abundances and for investigations where the quantification of noise is important.We conclude that the choice of either one or the other modeling framework should be guided by the specific goals of the analysis and the dynamic features of the data.Availability of algorithms used https://github.com/LBSA-VoitLab/Comparison-Between-LV-and-MAR-Models-of-Ecological-Interaction-SystemsCompeting Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.},

abstract = {Abstract Point 1: The ecological models of Alfred J. Lotka and Vito Volterra have had an enormous impact on ecology over the past century. Some of the earliest—and clearest—experimental tests of these models were famously conducted by Georgy Gause in the 1930s. Although well known, the data from these experiments are not widely available and are often difficult to analyze using standard statistical and computational tools. Point 2: Here, we introduce the gauseR package, a collection of tools for fitting Lotka-Volterra models to time series data of one or more species. The package includes several methods for parameter estimation and optimization, and includes 42 datasets from Gause's species interaction experiments and related work. Additionally, we include with this paper a short blog post discussing the historical importance of these data and models, and an R vignette with a walk-through introducing the package methods. The package is available for download at github.com/adamtclark/gauseR. Point 3: To demonstrate the package, we apply it to several classic experimental studies from Gause, as well as two other well-known datasets on multi-trophic dynamics on Isle Royale, and in spatially structured mite populations. In almost all cases, models fit observations closely and fitted parameter values make ecological sense. Point 4: Taken together, we hope that the methods, data, and analyses that we present here provide a simple and user-friendly way to interact with complex ecological data. We are optimistic that these methods will be especially useful to students and educators who are studying ecological dynamics, as well as researchers who would like a fast tool for basic analyses.},

abstract = {The purpose of mathematical models is, in principle, to assist management with decision-making processes in various fields of science. These models invariably include a number of parameters, of which the method of estimation is often in question when the models as managerial tools are evaluated. Advanced software packages involving artificial intelligence are available to estimate these parameters, and have been proven to be extremely effective. However, these techniques are expensive, require expert knowledge and often are not accessible to scientists. In this paper we discuss two alternative methods to estimate the parameters, using basic mathematical and statistical principles and a standard linear regression software package. The first method is referred to as the Integral method and the second as the Log Integral method. As an example, both these techniques are applied to determine the unknown parameters in a system of non-linear differential equations that describe an available set of data. To illustrate the effectiveness of these simplistic methods, a three competing species Lotka–Volterra model is used as vehicle: For a given data set the model parameters obtained by an advanced artificial intelligence method are compared to the parameter values obtained when applying the proposed methods. The different approaches result in completely different estimates of the parameter values for the system, yet the solutions, using these different sets of parameters values, fit the raw data equally well. The Integral and Log Integral methods are accessible to researchers with little knowledge of mathematics, statistics or technology, and are not restricted by the nature of the problem, the number of equations or number of parameters involved. These methods are applicable to a broad spectrum of dynamical systems originating in the fields of environmental, physical, biological and social sciences.}

In addition to giving quantitative predictions, the techniques also reveal how different qualitative patterns of species interactions either buffer or accentuate population responses to environmental trends.

abstract = {Abstract Multivariate autoregressive (MAR) models are an increasingly popular technique to infer interaction strengths between species in a community and to predict the community response to environmental change. The most commonly employed MAR(1) models, with one time lag, can be viewed either as multispecies competition models with Gompertz density dependence or, more generally, as a linear approximation of more complex, nonlinear dynamics around stable equilibria. This latter interpretation allows for broader applicability, but may come at a cost in terms of interpretation of estimates and reliability of both short- and long-term predictions. We investigate what these costs might be by fitting MAR(1) models to simulated 2-species competition, consumer-resource and host–parasitoid systems, as well as a larger food web influenced by the environment. We review how MAR(1) coefficients can be interpreted and evaluate how reliable are estimates of interaction strength, rank, or sign; accuracy of short-term forecasts; as well as the ability of MAR(1) models to predict the long-term responses of communities submitted to environmental change such as PRESS perturbations. The net effects of species j on species i are usually (90\%-95\%) well recovered in terms of sign or rank, with the notable exception of overcompensatory dynamics. In actual values, net effects of species j on species i are not well recovered when the underlying dynamics are nonlinear. MAR(1) models are better at making short-term qualitative forecasts (next point going up or down) than at predicting long-term responses to environmental perturbations, which can be severely over- as well as underestimated. We conclude that when applying MAR(1) models to ecological data, inferences on net effects among species should be limited to signs, or the Gompertz assumption should be tested and discussed. This particular assumption on density-dependence (log-linearity) is also required for unbiased long-term predictions. Overall, we think that MAR(1) models are highly useful tools to resolve and characterize community dynamics, but we recommend to use them in conjunction with alternative, nonlinear models resembling the ecological context in order to improve their interpretation in specific applications.},

    abstract = { Estimation of intra- and interspecific interactions from time-series on species-rich communities is challenging due to the high number of potentially interacting species pairs. The previously proposed sparse interactions model overcomes this challenge by assuming that most species pairs do not interact. We propose an alternative model that does not assume that any of the interactions are necessarily zero, but summarizes the influences of individual species by a small number of community-level drivers. The community-level drivers are defined as linear combinations of species abundances, and they may thus represent e.g. the total abundance of all species or the relative proportions of different functional groups. We show with simulated and real data how our approach can be used to compare different hypotheses on community structure. In an empirical example using aquatic microorganisms, the community-level drivers model clearly outperformed the sparse interactions model in predicting independent validation data. }
