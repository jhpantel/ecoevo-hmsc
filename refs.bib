abstract = {The major theories regarding the combined influence of the environment and species interactions on population and community dynamics appear to conflict. Stress/disturbance gradient models of community organization, such as the stress gradient hypothesis, emphasize a diminished role for competition in harsh environments whereas modern coexistence theory does not. Confusion about the role of species interactions in harsh environments is perpetuated by a disconnect between population dynamics theory and data. We linked theory and data using response surface experiments done in the field to parameterize mathematical, population-dynamic competition models. We replicated our experiment across two environments that spanned a common and important environmental stress gradient for determining community structure in benthic marine systems. We generated quantitative estimates of the effects of environmental stress on population growth rates and the direction and strength of intra- and interspecific interactions within each environment. Our approach directly addressed a perpetual blind spot in this field by showing how the effects of competition can be intensified in stressful environments even though the apparent strength of competition remains unchanged. Furthermore, we showed how simultaneous, reciprocal competitive and facilitative effects can stabilize population dynamics in multispecies communities in stressful environments.},

abstract = {Abstract Species distribution modelling is an active area of research in ecology. In recent years, interest has grown in modelling multiple species simultaneously, partly due to the ability to ‘borrow strength’ from similar species to improve predictions. Mixed and hierarchical models allow this but typically assume a (generalised) linear relationship between covariates and species presence and absence. On the other hand, popular machine learning techniques such as random forests and boosted regression trees are able to model complex nonlinear relationships but consider only one species at a time. We apply multi-output Gaussian processes (MOGPs) to the problem of species distribution modelling. MOGPs model each species' response to the environment as a weighted sum of a small number of nonlinear functions, each modelled by a Gaussian process. While Gaussian process models are notoriously computationally intensive, recent techniques from the machine learning literature as well as using graphics processing units (GPUs) allow us to scale the model to datasets with hundreds of species at thousands of sites. We evaluate the MOGP against four baseline models on six different datasets. Overall, the MOGP is competitive with the best single-species and joint-species models, while being much faster to fit. On single-species metrics (AUC and log likelihood), the MOGP and single-output GPs outperformed tree-based models (random forest and boosted regression trees) and a joint species distribution model (JSDM). Compared to single-output GPs, the MOGP generally has a higher AUC for rare species with fewer than 50 observation in the dataset. When evaluated using joint-species log likelihood, the MOGP outperforms all models apart from the JSDM, which has a better joint likelihood on three datasets and similar performance on the three others. A key advantage of the MOGP is speed: on the largest dataset, it is around 18 times faster than fitting single output GPs, and over 80 times faster to fit than the JSDM. Our results suggest that both MOGPs and SOGPs are accurate predictive models of species distributions and that the MOGP is particularly compelling when predictions for rare species are of interest.},

abstract = {Species distribution models are useful for estimating the distribution and environmental preferences of rare species, but these same species are challenging to model on account of sparse data. We contrast a traditional single-species approach (generalized linear models, GLMs) with two promising frameworks for modeling rare species: ensembles of small models (ESMs), which average across simple models; and multi-species distribution models (MSDMs), which allow rarer species to benefit from statistical ‘borrowing of strength' from more common species. Using a virtual species within a community of real species, we evaluated how model accuracy was influenced by the number of occurrences of the rare species (N = 2–64), niche breadth, and similarity to more numerous species' niches. For discriminating between presence and absence, ESMs with just linear terms (ESM-L) performed best for N ≤ 4, whereas for GLMs and ESMs with polynomial terms (ESM-P) were best for N ≥ 8. For calibrating the species' response to influential variables, the MSDM hierarchical modeling of species communities (HMSC) and ESM-P were best for species with niches similar to those of other species. For species with dissimilar niches, ESM-P did best for N ≥ 8, but no model was well calibrated for smaller sample sizes. For identifying uninfluential variables, ESM-L and species archetype models (SAMs), a type of MSDM, did well for ≤ 4, and ESM-L for N ≥ 8. Models of species with narrow niches dissimilar to others had the highest discrimination capacity compared to models for generalist species and/or species with niches similar to other species' niches. ‘Borrowing of strength' in MSDMs can assist with some inference tasks, but does not necessarily improve predictions for rare species; simpler, single-species models may be better at a given task. The best algorithm depends on modeling goal (discrimination versus calibration), sample size, and niche breadth and similarity.
